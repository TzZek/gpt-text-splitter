# ChatGPT Text Splitter Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension is designed to enhance the experience of interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT. It allows users to input long text and splits it into manageable chunks that comply with ChatGPT's token limits. Each chunk can then be automatically inserted and sent to ChatGPT in a sequence, making it easier to work with lengthy text inputs.

## Features
- Text input field for user input.
- Automatic splitting of long text into chunks suitable for ChatGPT.
- Option to manually send each chunk or automate the process.
- Simple, user-friendly interface with a minimal dark theme.
- Developed with an emphasis on usability and efficiency.

## How to Use
1. Enter text into the extension's popup.
2. Click 'Split Text' to divide the text into chunks.
3. Use 'Copy Section' to send each chunk to ChatGPT sequentially.

This project is intended for anyone interested in enhancing their interaction with AI-based text generation and processing, especially for handling longer text inputs efficiently.
